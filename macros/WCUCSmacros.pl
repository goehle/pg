=head1 NAME

WCUCSmacros.pl - Macros to use with the Python code system and for writing
computer science problems.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These macros are for writing Python based computer science programs.  They 
make use of the codejail system from EDX (L<https://github.com/edx/codejail>).
There are two main objects, the first takes in Python code and the answer is
the (stdout) output of the Python code.  The other takes in Python code and
the answer is student Python code which is correct if it produces the same 
output as the instructor python code.  There are also some macros for randomly
generating variable names and strings.  

=head2 INSTALLATION

Before these macros can be used the codejail system has to be set up 
correctly.  This is a one time setup which needs to be done on the server

1. Install inline python: C<cpanm Inline::Python>

2. Create a virtualenv

   sudo virtualenv --python=python3 /wwsandbox

You don't have to use python3, but all of the WCU CS problems were written
for python3 and beacause the python code is included in the pg file, 
they will not be compatible with python2.  

3. Add the sandbox user

   sudo addgroup sandbox
   sudo adduser --disabled-login sandbox --ingroup sandbox

4.  Let the web server run the sandboxed Python as sandbox.  Create the file
C</etc/sudoers.d/01-sandbox> and add the following (using C<visudo>) 
where C<SANDBOX_CALLER> is the apache web user (e.g. apache or www-data)

   <SANDBOX_CALLER> ALL=(sandbox) SETENV:NOPASSWD:/wwsandbox/bin/python
   <SANDBOX_CALLER> ALL=(sandbox) SETENV:NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/find
   <SANDBOX_CALLER> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/pkill

5.  Edit an AppArmor profile. This is a text file specifying the limits on 
the sandboxed Python executable. Create the file 
C</etc/apparmor.d/wwsandbox.bin.python> and add the following. Note: If you
are not using python3 then you should change python3 to whatever non-symlink
command is eventually being run.  

   #include <tunables/global>
   
   /wwsandbox/bin/python3 {
       #include <abstractions/base>
       #include <abstractions/python>
   
       /wwsandbox/** mr,
       # If you have code that the sandbox must be able to access, add lines
       # pointing to those directories:
       #/the/path/to/your/sandbox-packages/** r,
   
       /tmp/codejail-*/ wrix,
       /tmp/codejail-*/** wrix,
   }

Then parse the profiles to activate them 

   sudo apparmor_parser /etc/apparmor.d/wwsandbox.bin.python

=head2 USAGE

You create a code object using either C<PythonOutput()> or C<PythonCode()>.  
The first argument to the function should be the code.  The following 
arguments can be provided as well: 

=over

=item files

This is a list of pairs, each pair is a filename and a bytestring of contents 
to write into that file.  These files will be created in a jailed tmp 
directory and cleaned up automatically.  No subdirectories are supported in 
the filename.  The files will be available to the jailed code in its current
directory.

=item argv

This is an array ref of command-line arguments which will be provided to the 
jailed code. 

=item stdin

This is a string, the data to provide as the stdin for the process.

Once you have created the object you can use the following methods

=item options

This can be used to get the options listed above and also to set them. 

=item code

This can be used to get the code or to set it.  

=item tests

This is for C<PythonCode> only.  If you specify a list of hash references
each containing one more more "argv", "files" or "stdin" keys, the output
of the original code and the student code will be compared for each set of
inputs in the tests list

=item evaluate

This runs the jailed code.  It returns the status of the jailed code.  The
stdout and stderr of the code are stored in the stdout and stderr attributes

=item status

This returns the status of evaluated code. 

=item stdout

This returns the stdout output of evaluated code. 

=item stderr

This returns the stderr output of evaluated code. 

=item cmp

This returns a comparator for the object.  For C<PythonOutput> the students
answer is compared to the stdout of the code.  If there is a runtime error 
then the correct answer is the class of the error (i.e SyntaxError). 

For C<PythonCode> the students answer is run as python code and the two 
outputs are compared for equality.

=head2 EXAMPLES

The following problem prints out some basic python code and asks students
to provide the otput of the python code.  The output is checked exactly, 
including the number of spaces. 
    
 DOCUMENT();      
     loadMacros(
    "PGstandard.pl", 
    "PGML.pl",
    "WCUCSmacros.pl",
 );
 TEXT(beginproblem());
 $showPartialCorrectAnswers = 1;
 $code = PythonOutput(<<EOS);
 var = 3
 print('The answer is: ',var)
 EOS
 $code->evaluate();
 WARN_MESSAGE($code->stderr) if $code->stderr;
 BEGIN_PGML
 *Enter the output of the code below:*   
 Code:   
 ```[@ $code->code() @]``` 
 Answer:   
 [____]{$code->cmp}{80}
 END_PGML
 BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
 Output:   
 :   [@ $code->stdout() @]
 END_PGML_SOLUTION
 ENDDOCUMENT();
    
Note that we are using PGML to generate the problem text.  PGML is a good 
choice for these types of problems because it is easy to write code 
blocks using C<```code```> and its easy to make preformatted text by writing
C<:  preformated>.  When making answer blanks do either C<[_____]>
for answer rules or C<[_____]*> for answer boxes.  

This example asks students to provide the output of a snippet of Python code. 
The code is provided with stdinput as well as arguements which are part
of the output.  Notice that the argv list is a reference to an array of strings.
 
 DOCUMENT();      
 loadMacros(
    "PGstandard.pl", 
    "PGML.pl",
    "WCUCSmacros.pl",
 );
 TEXT(beginproblem());
 $showPartialCorrectAnswers = 1;
 $code = PythonOutput(<<EOS);
 import sys
 var = input()
 print('The input is: ',var)
 print('The second argument is: ', sys.argv[2] )
 EOS
 $stdin = "Hello World";
 $argv = ['Arg1', 'Arg2'];
 $code->options(stdin=>$stdin, argv=>$argv);
 $code->evaluate();
 WARN_MESSAGE($code->stderr) if $code->stderr;
 BEGIN_PGML
 *Enter the output of the code below:*   
  Code:   
 ```[@ $code->code() @]```
 Input: 
 :   [$stdin]
 Arguments:   
 :   [@ join(', ',@$argv) @]
 Answer:   
 [____]*{$code->cmp}{80}
 END_PGML
 BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
 Output:   
 :   [@ $code->stdout() @]
 END_PGML_SOLUTION
 ENDDOCUMENT();        

In this example a file with name file is created containing the text Hello 
World.  The Python code opens the file and reads and prints the content. 

 DOCUMENT();      
 loadMacros(
    "PGstandard.pl", 
    "PGML.pl",
    "WCUCSmacros.pl",
 );
 TEXT(beginproblem());
 $showPartialCorrectAnswers = 1;
 $filename = 'file';
 $filetext = 'Hello World';
 $code = PythonOutput(<<EOS);
 f = open('$filename')
 print('The files contents are: ', f.read())
 EOS
 $code->options(files=>[[$filename,$filetext]]);
 $code->evaluate();
 WARN_MESSAGE($code->stderr) if $code->stderr;
 BEGIN_PGML
 *Enter the output of the code below:*   
  Code:   
  ```[@ $code->code() @]```
  Filetext:  
 :   [$filetext]
 Answer:   
 [____]{$code->cmp}{80}
 END_PGML
 BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
 Output:   
 :   [@ $code->stdout() @]
 END_PGML_SOLUTION
 ENDDOCUMENT();    

In this example students are asked to create code which prints the described
output.  

 DOCUMENT();      
 loadMacros(
    "PGstandard.pl",  
    "PGML.pl",
    "WCUCSmacros.pl",
 );
 TEXT(beginproblem());
 $showPartialCorrectAnswers = 1;
 $code = PythonCode(<<EOS);
 for i in range(0,10):
     print('The number is:', i)
 EOS
 $code->evaluate();
 WARN_MESSAGE($code->stderr) if $code->stderr;
 BEGIN_PGML
 *Enter code to produce the following output*  
 Output:  
 :   [@ $code->stdout() @] 
 Answer:   
 [_______]*{$code->cmp}
 END_PGML
 BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
 Code:
 ```[@ $code->code @]```
 END_PGML_SOLUTION
 ENDDOCUMENT();        

For this last example we ask students to write a program which will check an 
argument and either print the std input or a string depending on if the 
argument is 1 or 0.  This demonstrates how to set up multiple tests when
checking student code

 DOCUMENT();      
 loadMacros(
    "PGstandard.pl",  
    "PGML.pl",
    "WCUCSmacros.pl",
 );
 TEXT(beginproblem());
 $showPartialCorrectAnswers = 1;
 $code = PythonCode(<<EOS);
 import sys
 if (int(sys.argv[1]) == 1):
    print(input())
 else: 
    print('hello')
 EOS
 $code->tests({argv => ["1"], stdin => 'moop'},
              {argv => ["1"], stdin => 'spoon'},
              {argv => ["0"], stdin => 'warp'});
 BEGIN_PGML
 Write code which checks the first argument.  If it is equal to 1 then it prints  the contents of stdin
 and if it is equal to zero then it prints "hello".
 Answer:  
 [_______]*{$code->cmp}
 END_PGML
 BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
 Code:
 ```[@ $code->code @]```
 END_PGML_SOLUTION
 ENDDOCUMENT();
